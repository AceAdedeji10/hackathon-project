1. Loading the Dataset
The dataset is loaded using pd.read_csv() from a specified file path (C:/Users/HP SPECTER X360/Downloads/DATASET.csv).
This step ensures that the dataset is available for analysis.

2. Exploring the Data
df.head() displays the first five rows of the dataset, allowing an initial look at the structure and contents.
df.info() provides details on column names, data types, and missing values.
df.describe() summarizes numerical columns with statistics like mean, min, max, and percentiles.
This step helps in understanding the dataset's characteristics.

3. Checking for Duplicates
df.duplicated().sum() counts duplicate rows to assess data quality.
If duplicates exist, they should be handled (though the code does not explicitly remove them).

4. Handling Missing Values
The missing values in the shop_id column are replaced with -1 as a placeholder.
The missing values in the final_order_status column are counted and printed but not explicitly replaced in this code.

5. Verifying Data Integrity
The unique values in key categorical columns (event_type, platform, variation) are printed.
This step ensures that values are consistent and expected (e.g., only valid variation types are present).

6. User Distribution Analysis
Users in the Control Group (variation == 1) and Test Group (variation == 2) are counted using nunique(), which gives the number of unique users in each group.
The percentage of users in each group is calculated and printed.
This step confirms that the A/B test was distributed properly.

6. User Distribution Analysis
Users in the Control Group (variation == 1) and Test Group (variation == 2) are counted using nunique(), which gives the number of unique users in each group.
The percentage of users in each group is calculated and printed.
This step confirms that the A/B test was distributed properly.

8. Counting Users Who Entered a Shop
A subset is created where event_type == "entry_to_shop", representing users who visited a restaurant menu.
This serves as the denominator when calculating order rates.

9. Calculating Order Rates for Control and Test Groups
The order rate is computed as:
Order Rate = Number of users who successfully ordered/Number of users who entered the shop
Separate order rates are calculated for both the Control and Test groups.

10. Printing Order Rate Results
The calculated order rates are printed for both groups, providing a quick insight into the impact of the test.

11. Preparing for Statistical Testing
Counts of successful orders and total shop entries are extracted for each group.
These values are printed to verify correctness.

12. Performing a Z-Test
The Z-test for proportions is conducted using proportions_ztest() to compare order rates between the two groups.
The null hypothesis assumes no difference, while the alternative hypothesis assumes that the Test group has a higher order rate.
The Z-statistic and p-value are printed:
If p < 0.05, the difference is statistically significant.
If p >= 0.05, the difference is likely due to chance.

13. Platform-Based Order Rate Analysis
The order rate is calculated separately for each platform (Android, iOS, Web).
The results are printed to understand if order behavior differs across platforms.

14. Plotting Order Rates by Platform (Bar Chart)
A bar chart is created to visualize order rates for Android, iOS, and Web.
Different colors are used for clarity.
The y-axis is formatted with grid lines for better readability.

15. Plotting User Distribution (Pie Chart)
A pie chart is generated to visualize the proportion of users in the Control and Test groups.
The Control group slice is slightly "exploded" for emphasis.
Labels and percentage values are displayed.

16. Plotting Order Rates by Variation (Grouped Bar Chart)
A bar chart is created to compare order rates between the Control and Test groups.
The y-axis limit is set to 1 to standardize visualization.
Grid lines are included for better readability.

Final Outcome
The results help determine whether larger food images impact order rates.
The Z-test provides statistical validation of findings.
Visualization aids in understanding data patterns and differences across groups.
